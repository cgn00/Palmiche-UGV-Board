# Palmiche-UGV-Board üë®‚Äçüíªüöô

Palmiche UGV Board is a Proteus project for designing and constructing a board controller based on a Teensy 3.2 microcontroller for an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). The code for controlling the UGV can be found in this repository: https://github.com/cgn00/robot_control.

## Installation

To use the Palmiche UGV Board, you will need to download and install Proteus software on your computer. Clone this repository onto your computer and open the .pdsprj file in Proteus to access the design files.

## Usage

The Palmiche UGV Board is designed to provide a platform for controlling the various components of an UGV, including motors, sensors, and communication modules. The Teensy 3.2 microcontroller serves as the main controller, while the board includes connectors for various components.

The design files provided in this repository include examples for connecting motors, sensors, and communication modules to the board. The code for controlling these components can be found in the robot_control repository.

To use the Palmiche UGV Board, you will need to assemble the board according to the design files and connect it to the various components of your UGV. You can then upload the code from the robot_control repository to the Teensy 3.2 microcontroller to control your UGV.
